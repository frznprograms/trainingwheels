Hi there, and welcome to

# trainingwheels

trainingwheels was designed to be a simple, easy to follow, and intuitive package for common machine learning algorithms. 

As a student, when I first started learning about machine learning and AI, I found the wealth of resources online extremely helpful in figuring out all the complexities of machine learning. However, what I noticed was that many online resources focus on demonstrating the general idea behind algorithms, and then jump straight to talking about how to apply those algorithms in real life, mostly using popular and established packages like `scikit-learn`. While this is useful for those only interested in the practical application of such algorithms, I sought a deeper understanding of how exactly these algorithms can be implemented.

Therefore, I designed this package for like-minded individuals, with the hopes that many will benefit from using this package in their learning. Even if it doesn't work for a specific use case or dataset, I do hope that it will help with developing their knowledge.

Don't get me wrong, this package was **NOT** designed to replace or out-perform `scikit-learn` by any measure. Instead, my aim was to implement these algorithms myself without referring to the long and complex source codes available for `scikit-learn`, and to give people a chance to better understand how we can implement the intuition behind these algorithms, in code form. 

I hope that those of you who see this package, and the accompanying tutorial videos (work in progress!) will be able to better appreciate what goes on in powerful machine learning packages, which we often take for granted as effective adn convenient "black boxes".
